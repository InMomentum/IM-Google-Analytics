# IM Google Analytics

An easy-to-use Google Analytics plugin for WordPress.

## Installation

### Automatic installation

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "IM Google Analytics" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by clicking _Install Now_.

### Manual installation

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application.

* Download the plugin directory from `src/im-google-analytics`.
* Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the plugin folder to your WordPress installation's `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
* Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.
